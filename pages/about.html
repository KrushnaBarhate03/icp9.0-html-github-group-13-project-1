 <pr>
    As soon as guests walk through the door and you've flashed your smile, offer a welcome greeting. Be respectful when greeting individual customers; use “sir,” “ma'am,” and “miss.” CustomersThatStick.com found that when a customer feels disrespected by an organization, it is a “hot button” trigger</h3>
